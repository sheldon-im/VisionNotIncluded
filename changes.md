# Changelog

## Unreleased changes since 1.5.3

- Fix being unable to set per-robot access on a door's Access Control: the Robots category can now be drilled into to set individual robot access, not just the category default.

- Fix being unable to pick a specific resource in a storage building's filter (storage bin, bottle emptier, etc.): you can now drill into a category like Liquids to choose Clean Water or Polluted Water, even on a newly placed building where nothing is selected yet.

## 1.5.3

- Alt+H now reports the direction and distance to your home location without moving the cursor, the same way Alt plus a number key orients toward a bookmark.

- Fix custom scanner categories not sorting alphabetically: they now order by name among themselves, in both the manager and the scan cycle, so renaming one moves it to its alphabetical place.

## 1.5.2

- Renamed the mod to Vision Not Included.

## 1.5.1

- Fix the Apply button being unreachable in graphics settings: it now appears in the list as soon as a setting change enables it, so you can apply your changes.

## 1.5.0

- Fix Codex Categories type-ahead landing on the first section of an article instead of the section you searched for.

- Duplicants now report the practical suit they are wearing (atmo, jet, lead, or oxygen mask) when you cycle to them or arrow over them, and while following a dupe with the camera you hear when they put one on or take it off.

- Added custom scanner categories: bundle the taxonomy filters you use most into your own named categories that appear first when cycling scanner categories. Create and edit them from "Custom scanner categories" in the scanner settings; they are saved globally and follow you to every colony.

## 1.4.7

- Updated Prism speech library to v0.16.1

## 1.4.6

- Updated Prism speech library to v0.15.0

## 1.4.5

- The Select Module side screen (rocket platform module construction) now reads the reasons a module is not buildable, matching the tooltip the game shows sighted players. Reasons are also announced when pressing Build while the button is disabled.

## 1.4.4

- Type-ahead search now accepts IME-composed input, so players using a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean IME can type CJK characters to filter lists.
- Fix a crash that could happen after using copy-building (PlanScreen's Copy hotkey) when the game's copy didn't actually enter build mode. The mod was previously pushing a build handler in this case, then crashing on the first rectangle selection because no build tool was active.

## 1.4.3

- Fix the game crashing when opening the material picker for a multi-ingredient building (e.g. Gas Filter) before each ingredient slot had a default material chosen.

## 1.4.2

- Shift+Home (scanner orient) now appends the current item's name after the direction, so you can confirm what you're getting the bearing for.

## 1.4.1

- Fix fast travel jump silently failing when the menu was opened from build or tool mode. The cursor now teleports to the selected point regardless of which handler is on top.
- Add a Relocate action to the fast travel menu (Shift+V), between Rename and Delete, that moves an existing point to the cursor's current location.

## 1.4.0

- Add a fast travel menu (Shift+V) for naming and jumping to cursor positions on the active world. Each entry stores a name and grid coordinates; right-arrow into an entry to rename or delete it. Bookmarks are scoped to the colony and the asteroid, and live in a YAML file alongside the save so the .sav itself stays unchanged.

## 1.3.9

- Fix sandbox parameter sliders (mass, temperature, etc.) so the value you set is actually applied. Adjustments now persist to the sandbox settings, so the brush paints with your chosen values instead of the defaults.
- The OS mouse pointer now follows the focused widget across menus and side screens, so a sighted observer can see where the blind player is focused. Widgets inside scroll containers are brought into view before the pointer is moved.

## 1.3.8

- Text edit fields now speak as you navigate: arrow keys announce the character to the right of the caret, Ctrl+arrows announce the next word, Home/End jump and announce, Up/Down re-read the full contents, and Backspace/Delete announce what was removed.
- Text edit fields now support selection: Shift+arrows, Ctrl+Shift+arrows, Shift+Home/End, and Ctrl+A announce what was selected or unselected. Ctrl+C copies the current selection (or the full text when nothing is selected).

## 1.3.7

- Activating a notification or a Vitals row now moves the cursor to the focused target, so reading the cursor announces the POI instead of your previous location.
- Type-ahead search now accepts space-delimited abbreviations: typing "ga pi" matches "Gas Pipe", "o n i" matches "Oxygen Not Included", etc. Each token must prefix a distinct word, in order. Existing matches are unchanged and always outrank abbreviation matches.
- Type-ahead search now ranks shorter names first across all match tiers, with match position as the tiebreaker (e.g. searching "wood" puts "Pinewood" before "Oakwood Shelf")
- Fix build rect mode so pressing Enter after setting one corner completes the rectangle at the cursor instead of speaking "no valid cells"
- Add Hijacked Headquarters "Choose Blueprint" catalog screen: browse printable critters and plants as a searchable tree, then flip to a details tab to hear description, cost, and trigger a Print.
- Trapped duplicants are now announced immediately when they become trapped, even if you're viewing a different world. A follow-up message confirms when they're no longer trapped.

## 1.3.6

- Fix valve side screen reading flow rate as a percentage instead of grams per second

## 1.3.5

- Add Spice Grinder recipe selection screen with dropdown cycling and description readout
- Fix unable to drill into categories on side screens like the pedestal
- Fix cursor unable to reach map edges at high zoom levels

## 1.3.4

- Updated Prism speech library to v0.11.3
- Fix Alt+Left/Right not navigating history in the Codex content tab
- Help screen now shows keys for the active tab instead of a fixed list on all tabbed screens (Codex, Research, Skills, Schedule, Starmap, Inventory, Outfits)
- Pressing Escape or Backspace while type-ahead search is active now clears the search first instead of closing the screen or navigating history

## 1.3.3

* Properties tab now shows sky visibility for telescopes, space scanners, and mission control stations -- lists which columns are blocked so you can find and dig out obstructions
* Oil Well Caps (and other attachable buildings) now appear in the tile cursor, scanner order detection, and area scanner -- previously invisible because they use a different object layer than normal buildings

## 1.3.2

* Type-ahead navigation in storage filter side screens (conveyor loader, storage bins, storage tile item picker, and element/liquid/gas/logic filters) no longer silently hides items from the list -- previously, the letters you typed to jump to an item would also land in a hidden search box, leaving rows filtered out until you reloaded the save

* Duplicant physical appearance descriptions now appear in colony start, printing pod, supply closet duplicant list, and the Bio tab -- these describe what each dupe looks like (skin, hair, clothing, expression, posture)
* Tools now preserve overlay context -- activating dig, sweep, or other tools on a temperature or conduit overlay keeps that overlay's information in speech
* Tile cursor now announces buildings queued for replacement (e.g. placing an insulated tile over a regular tile)
* Supply Closet: wardrobe now includes a "None" option to clear a duplicant's outfit back to default
* Supply Closet: overjoyed response designer is now accessible -- browse balloon artist facades, select and apply them

## 1.2.2

* Wardrobe and designer: clothing items now include their descriptions in speech output
* Wardrobe and designer: empty slots now say the default item name (e.g. "Default Gloves") instead of "empty"

* Shift+D opens a full diagnostics browser with pin state cycling and criteria toggles
* Diagnostic alerts are now automatically announced when conditions worsen
* Liquids pooling on buildings are now spoken instead of being suppressed with the gas element
