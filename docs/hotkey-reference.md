# ONI Hotkey Reference

Reference of all ONI key bindings and mod key assignments.
Source: decompiled `Global.GenerateDefaultBindings()` and mod source.

## How Input Works

The mod uses two mechanisms together:

- **Detection**: `UnityEngine.Input.GetKeyDown()` in handler `Tick()` methods (via `KeyPoller`). The mod only checks keys in the handler currently on top of its `HandlerStack`, so keys are naturally scoped to the active mod screen.
- **Suppression**: `ModInputRouter`, registered in the game's `KInputHandler` tree at priority 50 (above `PlayerController` at 20, `CameraController` at 1). It receives every `KButtonEvent` from the game's input pipeline and consumes events the mod claims, preventing game handlers from seeing them.

Suppression works through three mechanisms in `ModInputRouter`:
1. **`_globalBlockedActions`**: Always blocks `Plan1-14` and `PanUp/Down/Left/Right` regardless of handler state.
2. **`CapturesAllInput`**: When the active handler has this flag (screen handlers like menus, tables, cluster map), ALL non-passthrough keys are consumed.
3. **`ConsumedKeys`**: Per-handler list of specific physical keys to consume when `CapturesAllInput` is false (used by `TileCursorHandler`, `BuildToolHandler`, `ToolHandler`).

When the mod uses a key, it must also suppress the game's binding for that key via one of these mechanisms, or the game action will fire alongside the mod action.

## Game Binding Groups

| Group | When Active | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Root | Always during gameplay | Escape, Pause, Speed, Overlays, Camera Pan, Tool activations |
| Navigation | Always during gameplay | Camera bookmarks (Ctrl+1-0, Shift+1-0) |
| BuildingsMenu | Build submenu open | A-Z letter keys for building selection |
| Building | Building selected in details | \\, [, ], Enter (toggle), / (open/close) |
| Sandbox | Sandbox tools active | Shift+letter combos for sandbox tools |
| Debug | Debug mode enabled | Backtick, Backspace, Ctrl/Alt combos |
| CinematicCamera | After Alt+S | Camera controls rebound to WASD, I/O zoom |
| Management | Management screen open | L, F, V, R, ., J, E, U, Z |

## Keys NOT Bound by ONI (Root context)

These have no Root-context game binding, making them safe for the mod without needing to suppress anything during normal gameplay:

- **Arrow keys** -- natural choice for accessibility cursor
- **PageUp, PageDown, Home, End** -- used by mod scanner
- **Ctrl+R, Ctrl+B** -- used by mod (red alert, ruler)
- **Q** (bare, no modifier) -- bound only in BuildingsMenu context (build submenu letter key), not Root
- **Backspace** (bare) -- bound only in Debug context (DebugToggle), not Root
- **Backtick** -- bound only in Debug context (ToggleProfiler), not Root

## Screen Reader Keys -- NEVER Bind

| Key | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Insert | NVDA modifier |
| CapsLock | NVDA/JAWS modifier |
| Insert+anything | NVDA commands |

## Mod Hotkeys by Context

### Global (KeyPoller -- always active when mod is enabled)

| Key | Action | Game Conflict |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Ctrl+Shift+F12 | Toggle mod on/off | Debug Trigger Error in debug mode only -- negligible risk |
| F12 | Open settings | Steam screenshot -- outside game input system, most users disable or rebind it in Steam |
| Shift+/ (?) | Context help | / is Toggle Open in Building context, but Building context isn't active when help opens |

### Tile Cursor (TileCursorHandler -- main gameplay)

Camera pan (WASD) and build category keys (Plan1-14) are globally blocked by `ModInputRouter._globalBlockedActions`. Other game bindings are suppressed per-key via `ConsumedKeys` on the tile cursor handler. Tool activation keys (G, C, X, M, etc.) are NOT consumed and pass through to the game, which is intentional -- the mod detects tool activations via `OnActiveToolChanged` and pushes appropriate tool handlers.

## Overwritten Game Functions

Keys where the mod suppresses the original game function. Only listed if the game function becomes inaccessible through that key while the mod is active.

| Key | Game Function Lost | Mod Function | Why Acceptable |
|-----|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| W, A, S, D | Camera pan | S = colony status, W = world selector, D = diagnostics. A is globally blocked but unused by mod. | Camera panning not useful to blind players; tile cursor replaces it |
| H | CameraHome (jump to Printing Pod) | Jump to home bookmark | Printing Pod reachable via scanner |
| Tab | CycleSpeed | Action menu (tile cursor), tab navigation (menus) | Speed cycling moved to backtick |
| K | Clear (Sweep) tool activation | (no longer consumed — passes through to game) | N/A |
| I | Disinfect tool activation | Read tooltip / info | Tools activated via mod action menu |
| Shift+D | Disconnect tool activation | Open diagnostic browser | Tools activated via mod action menu |
| 1-0, -, =, Shift+-, Shift+= | Plan 1-14 (build category hotkeys) | Bookmarks (with Ctrl/Shift/Alt), build priority (in tool context) | Build menu navigated through mod's menu handler |
| Shift+0-9 | GotoUserNav (camera bookmarks) | Go to mod bookmark | Mod bookmarks replace camera bookmarks |
| Ctrl+F | Find (game search) | Scanner search | Mod scanner replaces game search |
| Space (build/tool only) | TogglePause | Place/confirm building or tool area | Backtick pauses; pausing mid-placement not useful |

**NOT overwritten** (game function passes through alongside mod):
- **Ctrl+0-9** (SetUserNav) -- both mod bookmark and game camera bookmark fire
- **N bare** -- not consumed; Capture (Wrangle) tool activation still fires
- **G, C, X, M, B, P, Y, T** -- tool activation keys pass through intentionally; mod detects tool changes via `OnActiveToolChanged`
